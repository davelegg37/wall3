		<div>You have just tried and failed to escape a deteriorating situation in your homeland and find haven in a new land. You are not alone. Most people trying to cross the wall fail, and as in your case, simply disappear, i.e. die quickly, or get trapped and die slowly. Unlike them, you can live again by replaying the game, You may learn new strategies, or come to appreciate the cruelty of fate. We hope that you will develop empathy for the others, the Refugees.

		<div>Home Land You have 1 min in the home land before being disappeared.  You can choose to leave by water or by land, with or without the help of a coyote. You can choose to hide which stops the clock but incurs a risk of of being found and disappeared. You can try to get visa and enter legally. The rewards are great for legal entry but the chances of getting a visa are very slim. You choose by dragging  your avatar to the gate of your gate of your choice.

		<div>The Wall 
Discover the world of the refugee by playing  The Wall. In this game you must escape from a brutal and dangerous homeland to find what you hope will be sanctuary and a better life in a new land.  The homeland you are leaving is very dangerous and the longer you stay the greater your risk of death or imprisonment. Escaping the homeland and traveling to the new land is also dangerous and full of perils. Even when you finally get to the newland you may not be able to make a living and there is the constant risk of deportation. In playing the game keep in mind that for real refugees it is not a game. 
How to play. (To play just move the refugee avatar to the choices you wish to make)
To Win this game you must get from the homeland to the New Land where you must accomplish 4 tasks within a certain time limit. Once you start the game the clock is always ticking unless you go into hiding.
 
 
You begin as a refugee in a home land (  ).  There are three main places you can be in this game, The Homeland, which you must escape.  Outside the Wall, which you must get past to enter the New Land.  The Newland, where you must accomplish 4 tasks. To win the game you must get to the NewLand and accomplish 4 tasks within a certain time limit. 
The Home Land ()You begin the game in the Homeland. You will have 1 min to escape  or be disappeared. 
Being disappeared in the game is the equivalent of death. Imprisonment , captured by others and ends the game for you. All moves in the game carry the risk of being disappeared.  Some of your choices involve greater risk than others ie choosing to escape  with help of a coyote is less risky than going on your own.   
In both the homeland and the Wall you have the following avenues of escape.Legal --Getting a Visa is the safest  method of getting to the new land  and if you are successful moves you directly to the new land with legal status which makes it much easier to accomplish the four tasks you need to win the game.  Trying to get a visa takes a long time and is usually unsuccessful
 
Illegal --  There are four illegal ways to get to the new land and each is an available choice in both the Homeland and at the Wall. 
By Water with the aid of a coyote or without. Your chances of escaping with a coyote are greater and less dangerous  than without but cost money so you can only make that choice once.  By Land in which the choices  are basically the same but may not be available to you depending on where you are. 
In all three places you can choose to hide. The advantage of hiding is that it gives you time (stops the clock) Remember you only have 5 min to get to the new land and accomplish your tasks before the game ends.  
 
If you are successful in getting to the new land you must accomplish four tasks to win the game. If you have legal status the you have a greater chance of accomplishing the task then you if you are an illegal. 
You play the game by moving your avatar to various gateways in the place you find yourself. To move your avatar simply click and drag it to the gateway of you choice. 
 
 
 
 
 
  

</div>
		<div>The WallYou have basically the same choices at the wall as you did in the Home Land  but without the 1 min deadline. You can try enter by water or land with or without a coyote. If you have already used a coyote you can not use one again. You can still try and enter legally.
</div>
		<div>Start Game
</div>
		<div>The New LandOnce in the New Land you are in a position to win the game. You will be given four tasks and if you accomplish all four you will win the game. When you are given your task you must choose which  option will accomplish it. If you make the right choice you will accomplish your goal. If you are  ilegal your odds of not accomplishing it or being deported (disappeared) are greater than if you are legal.  You can also choose to hide or gain legal status just as you could in other parts of the game. If time runs out before you have accomplished the four tasks you lose the game.
